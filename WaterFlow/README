Small project simulating watershed.

Water is generated at n locations on the bottom of the screen and then a selfish algorithm is used to allow the water to "flow" downhill according to an uneven perlin-based
altitude that generally makes altitude decrease towards the top of the screen.

Made different streams of water "hydrophobic" to one another so if two streams merge instead of them overlapping they stay next to each other and make a single, wider stream
of water.

Implemented an anti-trap alorithm so that when local minimums are found in the perlin noise, lakes are slowely formed until the water overflows and contiues towards lower
altitudes.

"Prettified" the simulation.
