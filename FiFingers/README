Uses Handsfree.js

Each finger visible in the webcam is tracked by handsfree and made a source of FiCell

FiCell generates a single firesource cell that then generates flame, steam and smoke cells.

These cells all behave using their own FiCell rules and remain in a set grid allowing waving your fingers around to generate the illusion of creating a wind affecting the 
fire.
